# Restaurant-tips-analysis
Restaurant tips analysis sample project 
In this project, I analyze restaurant tipping patterns using data from this dataset: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RusAbk/sca_datasets/main/tips.csv". The goal is to uncover insights into how various factors—such as smoking preference, gender, and mealtime—affect tipping behavior.
