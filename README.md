# Restaurant-tips-analysis (Python - Pandas, Matplotlib.pyplot)
Restaurant tips analysis sample project.

In this project, I analyze restaurant tipping patterns using data from this dataset: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RusAbk/sca_datasets/main/tips.csv". The goal is to uncover insights into how various factors—such as smoking preference, gender, and mealtime—affect tipping behavior.

###Stage 1: Import and examine the data set.
```python
#Import the libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#Import the dataset into dataframe (df)
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RusAbk/sca_datasets/main/tips.csv")

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(df.head())
```
